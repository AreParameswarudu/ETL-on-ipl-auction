### Description
This project involves extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) IPL auction data for the year 2025, followed by creating visualizations. The aim is to provide insightful analysis and visual representation of the IPL auction data.<br>
This project showcases the end-to-end process of web scraping IPL auction data, storing it in a MySQL local server, and visualizing the data using Power BI. The data provides insights into the auction trends, player statistics, and other key metrics of the IPL auction 2025.

## Introduction: 
   The aim of the project is to use and elevate the concepts learned about ETL and integrating different tools and services to acheive the objective of perorming ETL on the IPL auction data of the year 2025. <br>
   In this project I have used:
   * PYTHON for extraction
   * MYSQL local server for transformation and querying
   * POWERBI for visualization and dashboarding.
   > feel free to use your own preffered tools when trying to replicate.

## Project Workflow:
  # Data Extraction
* Starts with extraction of data from the official website of [IPL](https://www.iplt20.com/auction).
* Utilized web scraping techniques <i> BEAUTIFUL SOUP </i> to extract auction data  from the official  website.

 ### Tools and libraries used: 
 BeautifulSoup, Requests, pandas.
 <br>
 
# Data Transformation
* Followed by loading the extracted data into MYSQL local server for querying and undergoing some transformations required.
* Loaded the transformed data into a MySQL local server.
* Configured MySQL to handle data querying efficiently.

### Tools and libraries used: 
     MySQL local server,DML (Data Manupilating language), DQL (Data Querying Language) .
<br>

# Data Loading and Visualization
 At the end, the data residing in the local server is connected to the POWERBI desktop for visualization.
 Created various visualizations to represent the IPL auction data insights, including:
* Player statistics 
* Auction trends and patterns
* Team compositions and budgets

 ### Visualization tools used:
